This code first checks if the current board configuration is valid. If it is, it recursively attempts to fill the board
using numbers 1-9. If it cannot place a number without violating the Sudoku rules, it backtracks and tries a different
number.

1. Initialize all domains: For each empty cell in the Sudoku grid, create a domain of all possible values (1-9).

2. Constraint propagation: For each newly assigned cell, remove its value from the domain of all unassigned cells in the
   same row, column, and box.

3. Backtracking: Just like in the previous code, attempt to assign a value to an unassigned cell. However, now you only
   need to check the values in its domain. If no assignment leads to a solution, backtrack.

4. Repeat: Continue this process until the Sudoku is solved or until itâ€™s proven that no solution exists.
